# Multiple-Client-Server-Chat-Program
This is an entertainment track hackathon project that mimics the basic functionality of a chat application like send and receive messages.

Back end uses socket programming to connect the clients to a server to establish communication
Front end uses GUI 

Future Updates:
1. Combine front end and back end to work together
2. Host the server on the cloud
